I obtained the python file from akshett/NASDAQ-ITCH-parser.
I updated the code file parser.py for my use and made some updates for creating project_2.ipynb. 

If someone wants to use the code.
Please download the environment file and first create the environment using 
environment.yml file and then use project_2.ipynb file calling jupyter-notebook.
